[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) docker image with Confluent (OSS), [Landoop](http://www.landoop.com/kafka/kafka-tools/) tools, 20+ Kafka Connectors

> View latest **[demo on-line](https://fast-data-dev.demo.landoop.com)**

### Why ?

When you need:

1. **Confluent** OSS with Apache Kafka including: ZooKeeper, Schema Registry, Kafka REST, Kafka-Connect
2. **Landoop** Fast Data Tools including: kafka-topics-ui, schema-registry-ui, kafka-connect-ui
3. 20+ Kafka Connectors to simplify ETL processes
4. Integration testing and examples embedded into the docker

just run:

    docker run --rm --net=host landoop/fast-data-dev

That's it. Visit <http://localhost:3030> to get into the fast-data-dev environment

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wch/fast-data-dev-ports.png" alt="fast-data-dev web UI screenshot" type="image/png" width="320">

All the service ports are exposed, and can be used from localhost / or within your IntelliJ.
To access the JMX data of the broker run:

    jconsole localhost:9581

If you want to have the services remotely accessible, then you need to pass in your machine's
IP address or hostname that other machines can use to access it:

    docker run --rm --net=host -e ADV_HOST=<IP> landoop/fast-data-dev

> Hit **control+c** to stop and remove everything

### Mac and Windows users only (docker-machine)

Create a VM with 6GB RAM using Docker Machine:

```
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 6000 landoop
```

Run `docker-machine ls` to verify that the Docker Machine is running correctly. The command's output should be similar to:

```
$ docker-machine ls
NAME        ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
landoop     *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v17.03.1-ce
```

Configure your terminal to be able to use the new Docker Machine named landoop:

```
eval $(docker-machine env landoop)
```

And run the Kafka Development Environment. Define ports, advertise the hostname and use extra parameters:

```
docker run --rm -p 2181:2181 -p 3030:3030 -p 8081-8083:8081-8083 \
           -p 9581-9585:9581-9585 -p 9092:9092 -e ADV_HOST=192.168.99.100 \
           landoop/fast-data-dev:latest
```

That's it. Visit <http://192.168.99.100:3030> to get into the fast-data-dev environment

### Customize execution

You can further customize the execution of the container with additional flags:

 optional_parameters            | usage
------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 `WEB_ONLY=1      `             | Run in combination with `--net=host` and docker will connect to the kafka services running on the local host
 `CONNECT_HEAP=3G`              | Configure the heap size allocated to Kafka Connect
 `PASSWORD=password`            | Protect you kafka resources when running publicly with username `kafka` with the password you set
 `USER=username`                | Run in combination with `PASSWORD` to specify the username to use on basic auth
 `RUNTESTS=0`                   | Disable the (coyote) integration tests from running when container starts
 `FORWARDLOGS=0`                | Disable running 5 file source connectors that bring application logs into Kafka topics
 `RUN_AS_ROOT=1`                | Run kafka as `root` user - useful to i.e. test HDFS connector
 `DISABLE_JMX=1`                | Disable JMX - enabled by default on ports 9581 - 9585
 `TOPIC_DELETE=0`               | Configure whether you can delete topics. By default topics can be deleted.
 `<SERVICE>_PORT=<PORT>`        | Custom port `<PORT>` for service, where `<SERVICE>` one of `ZK`, `BROKER`, `BROKER_SSL`, `REGISTRY`, `REST`, `CONNECT`
 `ENABLE_SSL=1`                 | Generate a CA, key-certificate pairs and enable a SSL port on the broker
 `SSL_EXTRA_HOSTS=IP1,host2`    | If SSL is enabled, extra hostnames and IP addresses to include to the broker certificate
 `DISABLE=<CONNECTOR>[,<CON2>]` | Disable one or more connectors. E.g `hbase`, `elastic` (Stream Reactor version), `elasticsearch` (Confluent version)
 `DEBUG=1`                      | Print stdout and stderr of all processes to container's stdout. Useful for debugging early container exits.
 `SAMPLEDATA=0`                 | Do not create `position-reports` topic with sample Avro records.
 `JSON=1`                       | Store data using JSON rather than AVRO

And execute the docker image if needed in `daemon` mode:

    docker run -e CONNECT_HEAP=3G -d landoop/fast-data-dev

### Versions

The latest version of this docker image tracks our latest stable tag (cp3.1.2). Our
images include:

 Version                       | Confluent OSS | Landoop tools | Apache Kafka  | Connectors

Fast-data-dev contains a collection of popular open source connectors
including *stream-reactor* v.0.2.5.

Please note the [BSL license](http://www.landoop.com/bsl/) of the tools. To use them on a PROD
cluster with > 3 Kafka nodes, you should contact us.

### Building it

To build it just run:

    docker build -t landoop/fast-data-dev .

Also periodically pull from docker hub to refresh your cache.

### Advanced settings

#### Custom Ports

To use custom ports for the various services, you can take advantage of the
`ZK_PORT`, `BROKER_PORT`, `REGISTRY_PORT`, `REST_PORT`, `CONNECT_PORT` and
`WEB_PORT` environment variables. One catch is that you can't swap ports; e.g
to assign 8082 (default REST Proxy port) to the brokers.

    docker run --rm -it \
               -p 3181:3181 -p 3040:3040 -p 7081:7081 \
               -p 7082:7082 -p 7083:7083 -p 7092:7092 \
               -e ZK_PORT=3181 -e WEB_PORT=3040 -e REGISTRY_PORT=8081 \
               -e REST_PORT=7082 -e CONNECT_PORT=7083 -e BROKER_PORT=7092 \
               -e ADV_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
               landoop/fast-data-dev

#### Execute kafka command line tools

Do you need to execute kafka related console tools? Whilst your Kafka containers is running,
try something like:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host landoop/fast-data-dev kafka-topics --zookeeper localhost:2181 --list

Or enter the container to use any tool as you like:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host landoop/fast-data-dev bash

#### View logs

Every application stores its logs under `/var/log` inside the container.
If you have your container's ID, or name, you could do something like:

    docker exec -it <ID> cat /var/log/broker.log

#### Enable additional connectors

If you have a custom connector you would like to use, you can mount it at folder
`/connectors`. `CLASSPATH` variable for Kafka Connect is set up as
`/connectors/*`, so it will use any jar files it will find inside this
directory:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host \
               -v /path/to/my/connector/jar/files:/connectors \
               landoop/fast-data-dev

#### Build Kafka-Connect clusters

If you already have your Kafka brokers and ZKs infrastructure in place and you need
to spin up a few Kafka-Connect clusters, check the [fast-data-connect-cluster](https://github.com/landoop/fast-data-connect-cluster),
a spinoff of fast-data-dev aimed at running many connect clusters concurrently.

In short, you can run a docker Kafka-Connect instance to join the connect-cluster with ID = `01` with:

    docker run -d --net=host \
               -e ID=01 \
               -e BS=broker1:9092,broker2:9092 \
               -e ZK=zk1:2181,zk2:2181 \
               -e SC=http://schema-registry:8081 \
               -e HOST=<IP OR FQDN>
               landoop/fast-data-dev-connect-cluster

#### Enable SSL on Broker

Do you want to test your application over an authenticated TLS connection to the
broker? We got you covered. Enable TLS via `-e ENABLE_SSL=1`:

    docker run --rm --net=host \
               -e ENABLE_SSL=1 \
               landoop/fast-data-dev

When fast-data-dev spawns, it will create a self-signed CA. From that it will
create a truststore and two signed key-certificate pairs, one for the broker,
one for your client. You can access the truststore and the client's keystore
from our Web UI, under `/certs` (e.g http://localhost:3030/certs). The password
for both the keystores and the TLS key is `fastdata`.
The SSL port of the broker is `9093`, configurable via the `BROKER_SSL_PORT`
variable.

Here is a simple example of how the SSL functionality can be used. Let's spawn
a fast-data-dev to act as the server:

    docker run --rm --net=host -e ENABLE_SSL=1 -e RUNTESTS=0 landoop/fast-data-dev

On a new console, run another instance of fast-data-dev only to get access to
Kafka command line utilities and use TLS to connect to the broker of the former
container:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host --entrypoint bash landoop/fast-data-dev
    root@fast-data-dev / $ wget localhost:3030/certs/truststore.jks
    root@fast-data-dev / $ wget localhost:3030/certs/client.jks
    root@fast-data-dev / $ kafka-producer-perf-test --topic tls_test \
      --throughput 100000 --record-size 1000 --num-records 2000 \
      --producer-props bootstrap.servers="localhost:9093" security.protocol=SSL \
      ssl.keystore.location=client.jks ssl.keystore.password=fastdata \
      ssl.key.password=fastdata ssl.truststore.location=truststore.jks \
      ssl.truststore.password=fastdata

Since the plaintext port is also available, you can test both and find out
which is faster and by how much. ;)

### Advanced Connector settings

#### HDFS Connector

HDFS connector currently is incompatible with the HBase connector due to classpath
shadowing. To make HDFS connector work, disable the HBase connector using the
`DISABLE` environment variable:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host \
               -e DISABLE=hbase \
               landoop/fast-data-dev

#### Disable Connectors

If one or more connectors create issues for you, you can disable them on
startup using the `DISABLE` environment variable. It takes a comma separated
list of connector names you want to disable:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host \
               -e DISABLE=elastic,hbase \
               landoop/fast-data-dev

#### HBase Connector

Due to some issues with dependencies, the ElasticSearch connector and the HBase
connector cannot coexist. Whilst both are available, HBase won't work. We do provide
the `PREFER_HBASE` environment variable which will remove ElasticSearch (and the
Twitter connector) to let HBase work:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host \
               -e PREFER_HBASE=true \
               landoop/fast-data-dev

### FAQ

- Landoop's Fast Data Web UI tools and integration test requires a few seconds
  till they fully work.
  
  That is because the services (Schema Registry and kafka REST Proxy) have
  to start and initialize before the UIs can read data.
- When you start the container, Schema Registry and REST Proxy fail.
  
  This happens because the Broker isn't up yet. It is normal. Supervisord will
  make sure they will work automatically once the Broker starts.
- What resources does this container need?
  
  An idle, fresh container will need about 1.5GiB of RAM. As at least 4 JVM
  applications will be working in it, your mileage will vary. In our
  experience Kafka Connect usually requires a lot of memory. It's heap size is
  set by default to 1GiB but you'll might need more than that.
- Fast-data-dev does not start properly, broker fails with:
  > [2016-08-23 15:54:36,772] FATAL [Kafka Server 0], Fatal error during
  > KafkaServer startup. Prepare to shutdown (kafka.server.KafkaServer)
  > java.net.UnknownHostException: [HOSTNAME]: [HOSTNAME]: unknown error
  
  JVM based apps tend to be a bit sensitive to hostname issues.
  Either run the image without `--net=host` and expose all ports
  (2181, 3030, 8081, 8082, 8083, 9092) to the same port at the host, or
  better yet make sure your hostname resolve to the localhost address
  (127.0.0.1). Usually to achieve this, you need to add your hostname (case
  sensitive) at `/etc/hosts` as the first name after 127.0.0.1. E.g:
  
      127.0.0.1 MyHost localhost

### Detailed configuration options

#### Web Only Mode

This is a special mode only for Linux hosts, where *only* Landoop's Web UIs
are started and kafka services are expected to be running on the local
machine. It must be run with `--net=host` flag, thus the Linux only
requisite:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host \
               -e WEB_ONLY=true \
               landoop/fast-data-dev

This is useful if you already have a cluster with Confluent's distribution
installed and want just the additional Landoop Fast Data web UI.

#### Connect Heap Size

You can configure Connect's heap size via the environment variable
`CONNECT_HEAP`. The default is `1G`:

    docker run -e CONNECT_HEAP=5G -d landoop/fast-data-dev

#### Basic Auth (password)

We have included a web server to serve Landoop UIs and proxy the schema registry
and kafa REST proxy services, in order to share your docker over the web.
If you want some basic protection, pass the `PASSWORD` variable and the web
server will be protected by user `kafka` with your password. If you want to
setup the username too, set the `USER` variable.

     docker run --rm -it -p 3030:3030 \
                -e PASSWORD=password \
                landoop/fast-data-dev

#### Disable tests

By default this docker runs a set of coyote tests, to ensure that your container
and development environment is all set up. You can disable running the `coyote` tests
using the flag:

    -e RUNTESTS=0

#### Run Kafka as root

In the recent versions of fast-data-dev, we switched to running Kafka as user
`nobody` instead of `root` since it was a bad practice. The old behaviour may
still be desirable, for example on our
[HDFS connector tests](http://coyote.landoop.com/connect/kafka-connect-hdfs/),
Connect worker needs to run as the root user in order to be able to write to the
HDFS. To switch to the old behaviour, use:

    -e RUN_AS_ROOT=1

#### JMX Metrics

JMX metrics are enabled by default. If you want to disable them for some
reason (e.g you need the ports for other purposes), use the `DISABLE_JMX`
environment variable:

    docker run --rm -it --net=host \
               -e DISABLE_JMX=1 \
               landoop/fast-data-dev

JMX ports are hardcoded to `9581` for the broker, `9582` for schema registry,
`9583` for REST proxy and `9584` for connect distributed. Zookeeper is exposed
at `9585`.
